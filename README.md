Springboard Capstone 1
----------------------

This repository hosts all of the work for my first capstone project from the February 3rd, 2020 cohort of the Data Science Career Track with Springboard.

The goal of this project was to construct an actor centric dataset by using API requests from the TBDb movie website and build a linear regression model that could make accurate predictions on the data.

Project Workflow:

1. [Project Proposal](https://github.com/christianspybrook/movie_actor_linear_regression/tree/master/project_proposal)
>> Written proposal describing the problem to be solved, possible clients interested in the results, my dataset source, my solution to the problem, and the format of my final work.
2. [Data Acquisition](https://github.com/christianspybrook/movie_actor_linear_regression/tree/master/data_acquisition)
>> Notebooks containing  the code I used to extract and clean the dataset from TMDb.
3. [Data Wrangling](https://github.com/christianspybrook/movie_actor_linear_regression/tree/master/data_wrangling)
>> Notebook containing the code I used to munge the dataset into a form appropriate for this project and a written report describing the steps taken.
4. [Data Story](https://github.com/christianspybrook/movie_actor_linear_regression/tree/master/data_story)
>> Notebook containing the code I used to classify the actors by their career movie revenue totals and a written report describing the steps taken.
5. [Statistical Analysis](https://github.com/christianspybrook/movie_actor_linear_regression/tree/master/statistical_analysis)
>> Notebook containing the code I used to perform hypothesis testing on the distribution of the actors' genders with respect to their ages and career movie revenues and a written report describing the steps taken.
6. [In-depth Analysis](https://github.com/christianspybrook/movie_actor_linear_regression/tree/master/in_depth_analysis)
>> Notebook containing the code I used to find the best linear regression model to predict on the dataset and a written report describing the steps taken.
7. [Final Report](https://github.com/christianspybrook/movie_actor_linear_regression/tree/master/final_report)
>> Written report composed of all the previous reports followed by a conclusion recommending possible next steps to take.
